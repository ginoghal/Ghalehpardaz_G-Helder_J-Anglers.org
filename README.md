We will break down some key stuff for you here.




The [main.css] file is broken down into sections 
    -the general styling (mainly for nav, header and footer items)
    -custom styling for each individual page. Defined by a comment at the start.
    
    

    The 'Hero Images' are embedded through the css files, each section has its own and can be changed from there.
      Image size: 
        Width=  1900px
        Height= 420px
        
        
        
        

On the home page [index.html] you can update or customize the *Message Board* section.


    inside messageBaord
        h3 = The title of your message
        p = The body of your message
   
   
    *NOTE: If you want this section to have a permanent message and not set up as a memo-style board:
        h3 = delete
        h2 = use for the Title of your message
        p = The body of your message
        
        
        
        
The [gallery.html] can be added to as well as taken away from with ease. Using the commented-out "BLANK EXAMPLE" provided you will see how to do so. 


    Break down:
    
        Where there is a "#" is for you to add text.
        
            -the id="#" is for the Quick Links section to link to (please compare other sections and see)
            
            
            -the <img> inside of the "showcase" is for the large picture beside the description. 
            
            **This is the only image that needs to be a certain size**
                Image size: 
                    Width=  400px
                    Height= 400px
        
        
        Important
            <h1> = The main title
            <h2> = Sub title
            <p> = description of gallery
            src = "location of image"
            alt = "very brief description of image"
